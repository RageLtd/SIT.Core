**Update your Official Escape From Tarkov**

Remember, you must update your Online and Offline installs to use this.

**Update your SPT-Aki server**

* The SPT-Aki team will release an updated server for each new version of Tarkov.
* You can usually find the most up-to-date server on their [Website](https://www.sp-tarkov.com/).
* If the latest server is not on their website, it will be under development on their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Xn9msqQZan).
* The Server usually goes through several updates found in the dev-core section of their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Xn9msqQZan).
* If you get errors in SPT-Aki and mention you are using SIT to them, you will likely be ignored. You're best bet is to replicate the issue using a full SPT-Aki install first.
* The development / test servers usually have mods disabled. You will need to re-enable them.

**Update the SIT Aki Server Mod**

* The most up-to-date mod is available [here](https://github.com/paulov-t/SIT.Aki-Server-Mod)
* Please always follow the instructions carefully. They may change with each update.
