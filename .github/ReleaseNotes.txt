**Update your Official Escape From Tarkov**

Remember, you must update your Online and Offline installs to use this.

**Update your SPT-Aki server**

* The SPT-Aki team will release an updated server for each new version of Tarkov.
* You can usually find the most up-to-date server on their [Website](https://www.sp-tarkov.com/).
* If the latest server is not on their website, it will be under development on their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Xn9msqQZan).
* The Server usually goes through several updates found in the dev-core section of their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Xn9msqQZan).
* If you get errors in SPT-Aki and mention you are using SIT to them, you will likely be ignored. You're best bet is to replicate the issue using a full SPT-Aki install first.
* The development / test servers usually have mods disabled. You will need to re-enable them.

**Update the SIT Aki Server Mod**
* **For this version, you need to use the [0.13.5.0 branch](https://github.com/paulov-t/SIT.Aki-Server-Mod/tree/0.13.5.0)** and use the Code button to download the Zip.
* The most up-to-date mod is available [here](https://github.com/paulov-t/SIT.Aki-Server-Mod)
* Please always follow the instructions carefully. They may change with each update.

This version works with version 0.13.5.1.26215. It will still require a deobfuscated Assembly-CSharp dll which is included in each release.

**How to install**
- It is preferred that you install these releases automatically, using the [Stay in Tarkov Launcher](https://github.com/paulov-t/SIT.Launcher/releases)

OR 

- To install BepInEx dlls, you must first install BepInEx. [Follow the tutorial here to do so.](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)
- Copy the *.dll to the BepInEx plugins directory
- Copy Assembly-CSharp to your "emulated tarkov" game's EscapeFromTarkov_Data\Managed directory *this may downgrade your version*
